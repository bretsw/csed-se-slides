## Description

This presentation describes computer science (CS) educators’ inspired professional learning in the Computer Science Educators Stack Exchange (CSEd SE) online forum. Researchers have used metaphors of community, network, and space to conceptualize professional learning; here these frameworks were considered through the CSEd SE case. Social network analysis and content analysis were used to analyze questions and responses in CSEd SE; the affinity spaces framework was deemed most appropriate for initial studies of online professional learning.

## Extended Abstract

### Introduction

This proposal reports a Category 1 completed study on educators’ online professional learning. Specifically, this presentation describes computer science (CS) educators’ inspired professional learning in the Computer Science Educators Stack Exchange (CSEd SE) online forum, “a question and answer site for those involved in the field of teaching Computer Science.” CSEd SE is one of many subject-specific discussion forums hosted by the Stack Exchange Network, one of the largest online question-and-answer platforms in the world.

In the CSEd SE discussion forum, registered users can ask questions on a variety of topics related to CS education, and they can index these questions by assigning tags (e.g., curriculum design, student motivation). Users can also reply to (i.e., answer) questions posed by other users, comment on both questions and answers, and “upvote” or “downvote” questions and answers. Through the voting mechanism, contributors are held accountable to what they post on the forum; the content on the forum is thus regulated by forum users to a large extent. CSEd SE also has moderators and editors who have power to edit posts or flag posts as inappropriate.

### Framework and Research Questions

In the U.S., many K-12 CS teachers are isolated as the only CS educators in their schools, a situation referred to as “singletons” (Yadav, Gretter, Hambrusch, & Sands, 2017); this isolation impacts the opportunities for subject-specific peer-learning that CS educators might need. Hur and Brush (2009) described how teachers who feel isolated often seek online communities for peer-learning, growth, and development. In particular, high school CS teacher networks have been found to be helpful for inculcating a sense of community, promoting teacher reflection, and helping create a change in teaching practices (Ni, Guzdial, Tew, Morrison, & Galanos, 2011). However, because many CS teachers have time constraints and geographical limitations that limit the formation of offline CS communities, it becomes important to also foster online communities for CS educators (Ryoo, Goode, & Margolis, 2015).

Educational researchers have used a variety of concepts to frame the setting of educators’ online professional learning. There are frames that use “community” metaphors—such as communities of practice (Wenger, 1998) and socialized knowledge communities (Hu, Torphy, Opperman, Jansen, & Lo, 2018)—to foreground characteristics such as mutual engagement and shared group identity. There are also frames that use “network” metaphors—such as professional learning networks (Trust, Krutka, & Carpenter, 2016) and networks of practice (Brown & Duguid, 2000)—to foreground the wide variety of social connections and participation forms associated with social networks, especially networks supported by social media. Finally, there are frames that use “space” metaphors—such as affinity spaces (Gee, 2004)—to foreground the features of the medium itself and the content that defines it. 

This study examined CSEd SE to describe contributors’ participation and learning with these frameworks of communities, networks, and spaces in mind—specifically seeking to answer three research questions: RQ1. How are CSEd SE contributors using the forum? RQ2. What are the characteristics of CSEd SE's highly-connected contributors? RQ3. Do CSEd SE's highly-connected contributors tend to interact with some fellow contributors more than others?

### Method and Results

Forum data (e.g., questions, answers, comments, tags, contributor information) were collected using the statistical software R. For RQ1, from CSEd SE’s inception in May 2017 through June 2018, contributors to CSEd SE amassed a total of 559 questions asked by 210 users, and there were a total of 2,675 responses to these questions from 675 different users.

For RQ2, highly-connected contributors were defined as those who had at least three interactions with fellow users in terms of asking or answering questions—that is, users who had degree centrality (Kadushin, 2012) of three or more. There were 257 highly-connected contributors: 164 (78.10%) question-askers and 175 (25.93%) responders. The mean degree-centrality of the highly-connected contributors was 9.96 (SD = 17.88) and median was five; the range was degree of one to 146.

For RQ3, the spinglass clustering algorithm was used to determine whether or not there were clusters of highly-connected users in the forum—that is, users who interact more with others within a distinct group than with those outside that group (Kadushin, 2012). In addition, qualitative coding was conducted to find themes in the topic tags present in the various clusters. There was statistically significant evidence of clustering among CSEd SE’s most connected contributors, albeit with numerous interactions between members of different clusters as well. There were a total of eight clusters of varying sizes—two were very small and were not included in content analysis. The remaining six clusters ranged in size from 23 to 53 members, and each contained at least some questions and answers related to lesson ideas and curriculum design. There was also variation: one cluster seemed to be associated with teaching high school students, another on teaching undergraduates. A third cluster was associated with labs, a fourth with web development. A fifth cluster was associated with best practices, and the sixth—and final—cluster with student motivation.

### Discussion

CSEd SE demonstrated some community qualities and some network qualities, but did not neatly fit either framework. In terms of community, CSEd SE was characterized by democratic participation qualities such as elected moderators, upvoting and downvoting questions and answers, user-generated question-and-answer tags, and cluster topics not being dictated by the most active contributors. In terms of networks, the forum was characterized by participation inequality, diversity in participation even among highly-connected contributors, overlap and interconnection of clusters, and diversity in terms of professions and locations of the members. With these results in mind, framing CSEd SE as an affinity space rather than a community or a network could be the most appropriate approach to study how participants use the space for inspired professional learning—and this approach could be suitable for other un- or under-studied groups in educational technology research.

The presenter will engage audience members in discussion regarding the strengths and weaknesses of framing research on professional learning in terms of community, network, or space.
