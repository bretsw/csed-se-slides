# Research Questions

### Purpose

This study examined CSEd SE to describe contributors’ participation and learning with the frameworks of communities, networks, and spaces in mind.

### Research Questions

1. How are CSEd SE contributors using the forum?
1. What are the characteristics of CSEd SE's highly-connected contributors?
1. Do CSEd SE's highly-connected contributors tend to interact with some fellow contributors more than others?

# Results

### RQ1. How are CSEd SE contributors using the forum?

From CSEd SE’s inception in May 2017 through June 2018, contributors to CSEd SE amassed a total of 559 questions asked by 210 users, and there were a total of 2,675 responses to these questions from 675 different users.


```
##          Degree In-Degree Out-Degree
## mean:      9.96      4.98       4.98
## SD:       17.88      9.38      10.35
## median:    5.00      3.00       3.00
## min:       1.00      0.00       0.00
## max:     146.00     80.00     101.00
```

# Results

### RQ2. What are the characteristics of CSEd SE's highly-connected contributors?

Highly-connected contributors were defined as those who had at least three interactions with fellow users in terms of asking or answering questions—that is, users who had degree centrality (Kadushin, 2012) of three or more. There were 257 highly-connected contributors: 164 (78.10%) question-askers and 175 (25.93%) responders. The mean degree-centrality of the highly-connected contributors was 9.96 (SD = 17.88) and median was five; the range was degree of one to 146.

# Results

### RQ3. Do CSEd SE's highly-connected contributors tend to interact with some fellow contributors more than others?

*Spinglass clustering algorithm*:  
- Internal links and external non-links: YES! 
- External links and internal non-links: NO!

# Results

### RQ3. Do CSEd SE's highly-connected contributors tend to interact with some fellow contributors more than others?

In addition, qualitative coding was conducted to find themes in the topic tags present in the various clusters. There was statistically significant evidence of clustering among CSEd SE’s most connected contributors, albeit with numerous interactions between members of different clusters as well. There were a total of eight clusters of varying sizes—two were very small and were not included in content analysis. The remaining six clusters ranged in size from 23 to 53 members, and each contained at least some questions and answers related to lesson ideas and curriculum design. There was also variation: one cluster seemed to be associated with teaching high school students, another on teaching undergraduates. A third cluster was associated with labs, a fourth with web development. A fifth cluster was associated with best practices, and the sixth—and final—cluster with student motivation.

# Significance

---

# Significance

### Messy

CSEd SE demonstrated some community qualities and some network qualities, but did not neatly fit either framework.

---

# Significance

### Community

In terms of community, CSEd SE was characterized by democratic participation qualities such as elected moderators, upvoting and downvoting questions and answers, user-generated question-and-answer tags, and cluster topics not being dictated by the most active contributors. 

*Can we form communities in online discussion forums?*

---

# Significance

### Network

In terms of networks, the forum was characterized by participation inequality, diversity in participation even among highly-connected contributors, overlap and interconnection of clusters, and diversity in terms of professions and locations of the members.

*Identifying ‘experts’ in online discussion forums.*

---

# Significance

### Space

With these results in mind, framing CSEd SE as an affinity space rather than a community or a network could be the most appropriate approach to study how participants use the space for inspired professional learning—and this approach could be suitable for other un- or under-studied groups in educational technology research.

*How does use of the space change over time?*

---

# Significance

### Space

&gt; For some purposes, it may be easier to draw the boundaries of the United States as a geographical space on a map and then look at how different sorts of people use that space, i.e., what they do there and what they get from that space (e.g., import and export from it). In the case of Johnny and Janie in the science class, the two students are taking quite different things from the space.
